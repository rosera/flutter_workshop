# Lab 04 - Import Statements

Dart allows developers to use external code in a variety of formates.
Import packages tell Dart which external code is to be used in the application.

Built in Dart library URIs use the dart: scheme to refer to a library. Other libraries can use a file system path or the package: scheme to specify its URI. Libraries provided by a package manager such as the pub tool uses the package: scheme.
